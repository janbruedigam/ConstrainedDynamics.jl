$(TYPEDEF)

A `Storage` can be used to store simulation results for a [`Mechanism`](@ref).

Indexing example:
    storage.x[body_id][time_step_number][2] # returns the y-position of the specified body at the specified time step.

# Important attributes
* `x`: Contains the position for each body and each time step. 
* `q`: Contains the orientation for each body and each time step. 
* `v`: Contains the velocity for each body and each time step.   
* `ω`: Contains the angluar velocity for each body and each time step.
